          The Good Governance Advocacy International (GGAI) has called for a strategic partnership with the media
          to deepen the culture of transparency, accountability, and responsive leadership in Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking during a courtesy visit to the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Cross River State Council, 
          at the Ernest Bassey Press Centre in Calabar, on Tuesday, the Director General of GGAI, Leonard Anyogo, 
          described the media as “a fertile soil” capable of nurturing the “seed” of good governance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The media is key to national development. As agenda-setters, you have the power to influence the tone of public discourse,
          shape public policy, and lead accountability,</strong> Anyogo said. He emphasized that the mission of GGAI, a non-profit,
          non-political, and humanitarian organization, is to identify and promote excellence in leadership while advocating for 
          the rule of law, human rights, migration reform, and press freedom. 
          <strong>“I repeat: freedom of the press. I know why I’m repeating that,”</strong> he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the partnership, Leonard announced the offer of blanket membership to all accredited NUJ members,
          acknowledging the pivotal role journalists play in sustaining democracy.
          <strong>“Others may pass through many filters to join, but for you, we believe in your credibility and standing in society,”</strong>
          he said. He further disclosed that GGAI will be organizing a media-focused public lecture in the coming weeks,
          with 90% of attendees to be drawn from the NUJ and other verified media organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GGAI boss also noted plans to provide legal support and capacity-building opportunities to journalists in line with
          the group’s objective of strengthening institutions and enhancing policy implementation.
          <strong>“As the watchdog of society, we support advocacy efforts that put the interests of the people first.
          If we must hold leaders accountable, then the media must be empowered to speak freely and truthfully,”</strong> she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          She also assured the visiting team of the NUJ’s willingness to collaborate on projects that align with its values and mandate.
          Founded in July 2025 and headquartered in Ontario, Canada, with its administrative office in Nigeria, GGAI is focused on collaborating
          with institutions such as the NUJ to push forward a <strong>“reorientation agenda”</strong> centered on governance reforms
          and civic engagement.
